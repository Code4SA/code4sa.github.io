	<h3><b>Why #Hack4Water?</b></h3>
	<p>It’s hard to imagine water as a scarce resource when it’s there at the turn of a tap.</p>

	<p>The reality is that South Africa’s water sources are running low, with a severe drought resulting in five of our nine provinces being declared disaster areas.</p>

	<p>It is time to realise that water scarcity is no longer a government problem, with the knock on effect of the drought forecast to negatively affect food production, employment and inflation at citizen level.</p>

	<p>The Department of Water and Sanitation and Open Government Partnership have launched a national campaign calling South Africans to Hack4Water and submit innovative solutions to South Africa’s water challenges.</p>

	<p>We all consume water, therefore the only way to address these challenges is for government and civil society to work together to reduce our water usage promote water saving.</p>

	<p>What is your hack4water? Show us <a href="http://www.hack4water.org.za/">here</a>.</p>
