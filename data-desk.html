        <h3>What is corporate data?</h3>
        <p>Corporate data can be defined in four ways, although we’d love to hear from you if there’s more we should be looking for.</p>
        <ul>
					<li>Corporate structure. (i.e. corporate ownership, activity, key actors.)</li>
					<li>The relationship between the company and the state (i.e. tender information, ownership, potential conflicts of interest)</li>
					<li>The relationship between the company and its shareholders (i.e. shareholder structure, reported information, financial information)</li>
					<li>The relationship between the company and communities (i.e. environmental impact, social responsibility, fair business practises.</li>
				</ul>
