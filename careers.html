							</h4>

							<p>Code for South Africa is offering a paid sabbatical opportunity to experienced software developers who want to take a break from financial software and driving ad clicks.
								South Africa is a country of extremes and one of the most interesting places for software developers to live. We have a world-class technology sector on the one hand and high levels of poverty on the other. These two worlds seldom overlap with some of the most pressing problems underserved by technology.</p>
								<p>Civic technology is a worldwide movement that promotes better engagement between governments and citizens. It is premised on the idea that, used effectively, technology is able to change how government serves its citizens, promote dialogue and help create a more active citizenry.</p>
								<p>We are a non-profit organisation with a focus on civic technology. Our mission statement is <strong>to use technology and data to support informed decision-making to drive social change</strong>. We are all veterans of the commercial software world but decided to explore some of South Africa’s social challenges both as intellectual pursuits but also as an opportunity to use our skills to contribute to improving the country that we live in.</p>
								<p>Everything we do is open source and often draws public attention. You’ll get to work on a wide variety of projects which keeps it interesting and means there’s lots to learn. We’re a small team so you can get your hands dirty in almost everything we do and there are opportunities to travel to talk about what we do both locally and internationally.</p>

								<p>
									The sabbatical is based at <a href="http://www.codebridge.co.za/">Codebridge</a> in beautiful Cape Town and have flexible working conditions.
								</p>

								<p>
									We use industry best practices and technologies, including:
								</p>

								<ul>
									<li>Python, Django</li>
									<li>GitHub - <a href="https://github.com/Code4SA/">github.com/Code4SA</a></li>
									<li>Amazon EC2, S3 and RDS</li>
									<li>Agile processes using Pivotal Tracker</li>
									<li>Bootstrap, jQuery, D3, Leaflet</li>
								</ul>

								<p>
									You should be familiar with the technology stack we use (or keen to learn) and have at least 4 years experience under your belt.
								</p>
								<p>
									Most of all, you should want to make a difference to your city and South Africa. If you are interested, drop us a note at <a href="mailto:changetheworld@code4sa.org">changetheworld@code4sa.org.</a>
