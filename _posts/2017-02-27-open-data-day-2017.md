[International Open Data Day](http://opendataday.org/) 2017 is almost upon us and once again Code for South Africa, as part of our Codebridge programme, will join countries around the globe spreading the love and word about Open Data.

We’re doing something a little different this year, to open up access for more people and communities. something we hope more people will be able to access and take part in and following our theme this year, get to know their hood a little better.

So what is it we are doing, you ask? We are hosting an online challenge and inviting you to either host an event or participate directly online. No prior data knowledge is required - heck, we won’t even ask you to open a spreadsheet - although you’re free to do so. Instead we will be using some of our really simple, online tools to explore our hoods a bit more. 

We have [all the info you need to get up and running](http://codebridge.org.za/opendataday.html) in one place. Have a read and hopefully see you online on Saturday!
