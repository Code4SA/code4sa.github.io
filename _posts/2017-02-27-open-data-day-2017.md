[International Open Data Day](http://opendataday.org/) 2017 is almost upon us and once again Code for South Africa, as part of our Codebridge programme, will join countries around the globe spreading the love and word about Open Data.

We’re doing something a little different this year, to open up access for more people and communities. After all, the whole point of opening data is so that people can access it, right? So what is it we’re doing, you ask? We are hosting an online challenge and inviting you to either host an event in your own community or participate directly online.

Our theme this year is Know Your Hood. We are challenging people and communities to dig into the data and really get to know their community. 

No prior data knowledge is required - heck, we won’t even ask you to open a spreadsheet - although you’re free to do so if you want. Instead we will be using some of our really simple, online tools to dig into our neighbourhoods and find out what makes us tick.

We have [all the info you need to get up and running](http://codebridge.org.za/opendataday.html) in one place. Have a read and we’ll see you online on Saturday!

Oh, before we forget. There is a prize at the end of this mission, should you choose to accept it. Two R2000 prizes are up for grabs for the persons and/or communities who #KnowYourHood the best. 

Still not sure? [Have a look](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iI512PoMgbA) at what we got up to last year.

Good luck!
