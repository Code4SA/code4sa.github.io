Hi guys!

We have been working on two interesting data stories about causes of death, both published last sunday in [City Press](http://city-press.news24.com/News/this-is-what-is-killing-our-children-20160717) and [Sunday Times](http://www.timeslive.co.za/sundaytimes/stnews/2016/07/17/The-heartbreaking-legacy-of-South-Africas-HIVAids-victims). And guess what? We have the data available for you in case you want to dig a bit deeper or fact check us. :)

One is about [child mortality as reported by educational institutions](https://data.code4sa.org/d/p4kq-z4k7?category=dataset&view_name=Children-) and the other one is about [HIV/Aids related deaths, broken down by age](https://data.code4sa.org/dataset/HIV-Aids-related-deaths/tbhf-yaxm) (causes of death B20-B21-B22-B23-B24 according with the ICD-10 code used by StatsSA). 

If you are a journalist and you want to use the data for your reporting but you do not know how, please take a look to our [Data Journalism Academy](http://academy.code4sa.org/), we will be glad to have you here next time. If you already know how to work with excel but you have some questions, please drop me an email: daniela@code4sa.org
