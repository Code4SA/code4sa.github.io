Fresh data - get it while it's hot!

On Friday SAPS released the updated crimes stats data, covering 2015, broken up by station and province. We have extracted the raw data from the document since it was hidden in an Excel spreadsheet and cleaned it up a bit, to make life easier for you.

We have also recently added the Municipal Election Results by ward and district as well as demographic details for small areas across the country (Census) and Cape Town councillors attendance.

Take a look at the links below to access this data.
