Standard launched to ensure transparency and efficiency in contracting

The worldâ€™s first [Open Contracting Data Standard](http://standard.open-contracting.org/) (OCDS) was launched in Costa Rica today (November 18th, 2014) and is set to transform the way governments publish contracting data. The OCDS is a product of the [Open Contracting Partnership](http://www.open-contracting.org/) (OCP), developed by the [World Wide Web Foundation](http://webfoundation.org/) through a project supported by the [Omidyar Network](http://www.omidyar.com/) and the [World Bank](http://www.omidyar.com/). It will shine a light on how trillions of dollars of public money are spent, helping to fight corruption, improve service delivery and enhance market efficiency.

Governments around the world spend 9.5 trillion USD each year in contracting but until now, the data has largely been inaccessible.

The OCDS gives governments a common format and set of practical tools which will allow them to consistently publish contracting data openly. The OCDS will ensure contracting is transparent and efficient, allowing businesses to compete effectively creating business growth and maximising public engagement.  

Gavin Hayman, Incoming Executive Director of the OCP said: "It is time to end secret deals between companies and governments to make sure public resources are spent openly, effectively and efficiently.  Having accessible, comparable data covering the key items of information in a deal is key to achieving this objective"

Anne Jellema, CEO of the World Wide Web Foundation said: "Corruption adds an estimated $2.3 trillion to the cost of government contracts every year. This new standard is a big step forward in the fight to eliminate fraud and waste in public procurement, enabling contracts to be published online in a transparent, consistent and user-friendly format so that anyone can monitor them."

As part of the announcement the Open Contracting Partnership are inviting governments [to access the Standard](http://www.omidyar.com/) and adopt the tools to ensure contracting is transparent and efficient, and citizens and NGOs are urged to monitor and analyse published data.
