For the last months I’ve been doing research for Code for South Africa’s Data Journalism Academy, interviewing 20 media professionals about their experiences using data-driven journalism. How can news publications that already struggle to survive justify investing in such an expensive and time-consuming form of journalism? Some were confused by my questions “Why are you asking us? We’re trying to find this out ourselves”, others said data-driven journalism opened opportunities for those new and much-needed revenue streams.

Using their claims and hypothesis we shaped a survey about data-driven journalism. The survey got 114 respondents, 51 from South Africa and the rest from 30 other countries.

The survey was distributed in the [Naked Data newsletter](http://nakeddata.org/), to my research informants, South African newspapers and forums for data-driven journalism and journalism, as well as social media to drive engagement. 

We focused on three main questions and here are the results:

<h3>What benefits do you envisage data-driven journalism providing for your readers?</h3>

* The results about obstacles to use data-driven journalism in publications is based on only 65 of the respondents, 36 from South Africa, as the alternative “Lack of simple software/visualisation tools” was added after 48 had already responded to the survey.
* When I started to do my research I came over a survey done by Mirko Lorenz and the European Journalism Centre in 2011 that asks some similar questions, you can see the results from it [here](http://www.slideshare.net/lilianabounegru/preliminary-results-of-ejc-survey-on-training-needs-for-data-journalism).
