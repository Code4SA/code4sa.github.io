    Code4SAs Maps API makes it really easy to get South African political maps as GeoJSON and TopoJSON formats, perfect for popping straight into a browser.

The [Maps API](http://maps.code4sa.org/) serves geodata as JSON for quickly including South African political maps in data-driven projects. It was used for the live elections map, and is being used by WaziMap. Future work will see it including more datasets, as well as a user interface allowing non-technical users to quickly generate great-looking maps for embedding in their stories.

The Maps API is used in the [2014 Mail & Guardian Live Elections Map](http://mg.co.za/data/2014-05-07-live-elections-2014-results) and in [Wazimap](http://wazimap.co.za/).

We will be building on the Map API to include more maps, as well as easy-to-use tools to create simple to embed maps.
