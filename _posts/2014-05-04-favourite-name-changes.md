People legally change their names all the time. Sometimes what they choose for themselves is very amusing. We read through the government gazette and found the top 10 most entertaining examples.

* As an early birthday present before his 29th birthday, _Worst Cynette Monashane_ understandably changed her name to _Lebone Cynette_.
* _Violet Selebaleng Muhammed_, also 28 simplified her name to _Asia_
* _Handsome_ become _Hansom_
* _Branche_ waited 44 years to correct the spelling of her name to *Blanche*
* _Jacomine Cotzee_ of Panorama decided to go with _Rogue-Alaric_
* _Resign Nthani_ wasn't happy her name and changed her name to _Shirizane_
* _Elizabeth Mahlalo Modiba_ become her favourite car _Fortuner_
* _Jappie Mashamba Tepanyika_ prefers _Favour Divine_
* _Loganathan (Log) Chinniah_ understandably became _Pierce_

And finally, the best of the bunch
_Mistake Martha Bilankulu_, after 60 years became plain old Martha.

Amazing what you find in the government gazette. We read it, so that you don't have to.
