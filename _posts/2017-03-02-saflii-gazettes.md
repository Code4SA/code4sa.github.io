We're really excited to announce that over 14,000 South African Government Gazettes are now freely available to the public [on SAFLII's website](http://www.saflii.org/content/south-africa-index), with more gazettes being added daily. This includes over 370 Free State Provincial gazettes, the only gazettes in South African that are not available from the Government for free.

SAFLII, the Southern African Legal Information Institute, is an online repository of legal information that aims to promote the rule of law and judicial accountability by publishing legal material for open access in line with the objectives of the global Free Access to Law Movement.

Code for South Africa is very proud to help SAFLII add government gazettes to their collection of legal resources, making them broadly available to a large number of daily users. This was made possible through the [Open Gazettes South Africa](http://opengazettes.org.za) project, through which we're building the biggest freely available online collection of gazettes in South Africa.
