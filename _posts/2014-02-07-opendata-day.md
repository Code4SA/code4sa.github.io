StatsSA
-------

The census data usually comes on DVDs and needs to be installed on a Windows machine (yuck!). We can install it on the day on your machine. Alternatively, you'll have access to some of it view the hard-to-find [SuperWeb](http://interactive.statssa.gov.za/superweb/login.do) interface online. Also, you can ask me to extract specific datasets on the day. The same applies to the Labour Force Survey and other StatsSA data.

Education
