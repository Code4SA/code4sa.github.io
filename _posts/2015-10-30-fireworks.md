South Africa is heading into fireworks season, with Guy Fawkes on 5 November and Diwali on 10 November 2015. [OpenBylaws.org.za](http://openbylaws.org.za) helps South Africans to find out what the law says about fireworks in Cape Town and Johannesburg. Here's what you need to know.

In Cape Town, fireworks are controlled by [Chapter 11 of the Community Fire Safety By-law](http://openbylaws.org.za/za-cpt/act/by-law/2002/community-fire-safety/chapter/11/). You'll need to apply for a license if you want to set of fireworks in the mother city.

In Johannesburg, fireworks are controlled by [Chapter 3 of the Emergency Services By-laws](http://openbylaws.org.za/za-jhb/act/by-law/2004/emergency-services-bylaws/chapter/3/). It makes provision for fireworks on special occasions, including Guy Fawkes and Diwali, between 7pm and 10pm. You'll also need to ensure you comply with its other restrictions to ensure the safety of everyone nearby.

If you're unsure about the fireworks laws for where you live, contact your local municipality or the police before setting off any fireworks. Celebrate responsibly!
