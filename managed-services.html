      Data is the new bacon. Everyone’s got it, wants it or wants to create something with it, but not everyone knows how to do this. 
    </p>
    <p>
      As self-professed data junkies on a mission to open up data to drive more informed decision-making, we can help. We offer a range of data processing services from sourcing, scraping, cleaning, analysing and visualising data that can be packaged according to specific project requirements. 
    </p>
    <p>
      And because we’re non-profit, revenue generated from these services will go full circle to open up even more data that helps people make more informed decisions. 
    </p>
    <h3>Data Services</h3>
    <p>
      We love data and we want you to too.

          <h4><i class="fa fa-search fa-fw fa-2x" aria-hidden="true"></i> Data Sourcing</h4>
          <p>
            Does the data you need exist? Sometimes data has already been collected, and can be housed in data repositories, in government gazettes, or even online.  
          </p>
          <p>
            If it does exist, do you need assistance in getting your hands on it? The <a href="http://www.justice.gov.za/paia/paia.htm">Protection of Access to Information Act (PAIA)</a> provides procedure and process for acquiring public sector information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sometimes data is held in data repositories that can only be accessed through API interface.

          <h4><i class="fa fa-database fa-fw fa-2x" aria-hidden="true"></i> Data Scraping</h4>
          <p>
            You’ve got some data, but your machine can’t read it! Data can exist in many formats like online websites, scanned or saved pdf documents, and rendering data into machine readable format can be challenging. But it’s not impossible. We use a range of data scraping techniques to successfully extract data into .csv or .xls formats.

          <h4><i class="fa fa-table fa-fw fa-2x" aria-hidden="true"></i> Data Cleaning</h4>
          <p>
            It’s a dirty job, but someone’s gotta do it. Data is often disorganised, making analysing and transforming the data into visualisations challenging. Cleaning, formatting and shaping datasets can be labour intensive and technical and eat right through your project schedule.
          </p>
          <p>
            Data cleaning will remove invalid records and unnecessary spacing, de-duplicate data, fix naming or spelling inconsistencies, ensure correct numeric formats and reconcile categorical data. Shaping datasets based on project requirements will also save valuable time when it comes to analysing your data.

          <p>
            So you’ve acquired, converted, cleaned and shaped your dataset, and you are ready to dive in and uncover all the fantastic stories that are hiding behind the numbers. Data analysis helps to make sense of your data through:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              finding comparisons or contrasts
            </li>
            <li>
              comparing magnitudes and quantities
            </li>
            <li>
              finding trends and patterns indicating change over time, between geographic areas or categories
            </li>
            <li>
              finding relationships and connections
            </li>
            <li>
              examining key associations
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            During this stage of data processing, we can help identify patterns, abnormalities, and things that stand out.

          <h4><i class="fa fa-bar-chart fa-fw fa-2x" aria-hidden="true"></i> Data Visualisation</h4>
          <p>
            Data can be visualised in many different ways, which is defined by a number of factors like knowing which visuals will resound with your audience and understanding of the medium where the visuals will be presented.
          </p>
          <p>
            It’s important that data visualisations are simple, clear, strong and to the point, as your visualised data is the foundation that communicates the scale and importance of your message to your audience. 
          </p>
          <p>
            We use a number of open-source online tools to visualise data as charts, infographics, timelines or maps.
